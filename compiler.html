          <h1>miniJava Compiler</h1>
          <p><a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/features/052182060X/">miniJava</a> is a subset of Java simplified for instruction in compiler design. &nbsp;It is simple enough for a student to write a fully functional compiler over the course of a semester, but retains most of Java's procedural syntax and its basic object-oriented functionality. &nbsp;My implementation went beyond the basic miniJava specification, implementing all of Java's scoping rules, 'for' loops, and access modifiers for fields and methods.</p>
          <p>Undertaking this project imbued me with a strong appreciation for the design and implementation of programming languages, especially of the object-oriented paradigm. &nbsp;In turn, I have noticed that understanding how languages are parsed and how static, stack, and heap memory are allocated has help me learn about new languages much more readily, as I can draw comparisons to my knowledge of Java's implementation and know which questions to ask to fill gaps in my knowledge.</p>
          <p>The compiler also presented a major software engineering challenge. &nbsp;By employing the appropriate design patterns, I kept this complex project under my control. &nbsp;I implemented a state machine for parsing the tokens in the language, a recursive descent parser for the rules in the grammar, and utilized Visitor to traverse syntax trees for identification, type checking, and code generation. &nbsp;This is also the first project where I recognized the need for source control, which allowed me to experiment freely to find elegant solutions to my problems.</p>
          <p>The miniJava compiler was written in full Java.</p>
